Test Strategy
=============

Multiple layers of test is performed and as documented below

(1) API layer testing
-----------------------

   - API endpoints robustness testing
   - An end to end workflow using APIs

(2) UI layer testing
-----------------------

   - Different UI workflows for multiple customer scenarios

(3) API Benchmarking 
----------------------
   - API's are benchmarked to check on degradation

(4) API performance 
-----------------------

   - API's are checked with load and performance testing simulating actual production scenarios.
